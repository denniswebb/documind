# System Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of DocuMind's architecture.

## Core Components

1.  **Command Interpreter (`/document`)**: The main entry point for all documentation-related tasks. It parses user input and routes to the appropriate handler.

2.  **Documentation Engine**: The core logic for creating, updating, and managing documentation files. It uses a set of templates and analysis modules to generate content.

3.  **Workspace Analysis**: A set of modules responsible for analyzing the codebase to understand the tech stack, architecture, and file system.

4.  **Templates**: A collection of Markdown templates used to generate consistent documentation. These are stored in `.documind/templates`.

## High-Level Data Flow

1.  A user invokes a `/document` command in their IDE.
2.  The command is parsed to determine the user's intent (e.g., bootstrap, expand, update).
3.  The Workspace Analysis modules scan the codebase for context.
4.  The Documentation Engine uses the analysis results and the appropriate templates to generate or modify Markdown files in the `/docs` directory.
5.  The updated documentation is immediately available in the user's workspace.
